  <h2>
    Zachary Price 🐈‍⬛ ITIS 3135-091 🐈‍⬛ Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    I, Zachary D. Price agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS 3135, with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
  </p>
  <p>
