          <b>Background in the course:</b>
          Honestly, I don't have much of a background going into depth with HTML or CSS other than what I have learned in this course which has
          been a lot so far. I am ready for what the future holds.

          <b>funny/interesting story:</b>
          When I was marching for Wake Forest, as part of the shared experience program. Every away game that we went to and the first home game, 
          I found some set of stairs to fall with my Sousaphone on. I did break my streak though; I didnâ€™t fall in New York.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>something else to share:</b>
          My main passion has been technology but my curiosity to know how it works is not just bound to tech. I also have tinkered with car repair
          since I've owned my first car. Even to when I hit a deer with it, I did all the bodywork other than paint, as most of it was bolt on.
