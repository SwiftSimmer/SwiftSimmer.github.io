        <strong>Professional Background:</strong>
        I have had one internship so far with a security/IT company, that would be hired by many small businesses and big corporations to 
        provide ticketing and network monitoring services to fill the spot of an IT department for the businesses. I also have some background
        in programming where I have learned Python, C++, and Java.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Academic Background:</strong> 
        I started off college at Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem, where I was able to dip my toes into my interest in 
        Cyber Security. after starting at FTCC I learned about the SFS CyberCorps scholarship, leading me to apply to Charlotte.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Background in the course:</strong>
        Honestly, I don't have much of a background going into depth with HTML or CSS other than what I have learned in this course which has
        been a lot so far. I am ready for what the future holds.

        <strong>Funny/interesting story:</strong>
        When I was marching for Wake Forest, as part of the shared experience program. Every away game that we went to and the first home game, 
        I found some set of stairs to fall with my Sousaphone on. I did break my streak though; I didn’t fall in New York.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Something else to share:</strong>
        My main passion has been technology but my curiosity to know how it works is not just bound to tech. I also have tinkered with car repair
        since I've owned my first car. Even to when I hit a deer with it, I did all the bodywork other than paint, as most of it was bolt on.
