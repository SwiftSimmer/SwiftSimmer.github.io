    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <h3>Good CRAP Design: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></h3>
    <p>YouTube is a site where you can watch videos created by individual people or big companys.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Contrast: YouTube has great contast betweem the navigation and the text and videos on screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repetition: YouTube uses repitition, so that the user can easily identify the different items on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alignment: the allignment of the page is great the videos are sligtly off center because of the navigation, but everything feels like it is in place.
        </li>
        <li>
            Proximity: the videos are evenly spaced so tha they dont collide as is the same wit the navigation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bad CRAP Design: <a href="https://best-electronics-ca.com/">Atari Best Electronics</a></h3>
    <p>This is a site for a business called Atari Best Electronics where they document and sell Atari parts and accessories.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Contrast: The contrast on this site is awful I counted 13 different colors on the page and it is mainly text on a plain white background
        </li>
        <li>
            Repetition: There are issues with repitition as there are some centred paragraphs while the rest are allined correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alignment: There seems to be no consideration for the allignmet of the text it is just the default allignment with some centered objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Proximity: It seems that the proximity of the text to the edge of the screen was not looked at when designing this page making it hard to read.
        </li>
    </ul>
